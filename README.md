## Description

-  We created this app with a twist of IMDB and Pinterest in mind, utilizing a search and save function for the users favorite movies/musicians/tv shows.
-  Once a user chooses their category from the search drop down box on the main page they can enter the info specific to that category, if user puts an artist in the movie category it will not populate. Once a search input has been placed the user will be directed to a second page with the results. Artists show the poster img pulled from audiodb's api call along with their bio and discography. Movies and TV shows pull the poster img from the omdbapi site and also displays the movie title, cast members, tv rating, and total seasons (for tv shows). A "pin" button has functionality to save the info the user searches and places it on the first page if they so choose. A remove pin button displays with the saved info to give the user editing options. If the user wants to search another category the search button is also placed on the second page. The home button is attached to the TV icon in the header where there user can go back to look over their saved items.
- We wanted to create a fun application that challenged our skills in page functionality and technical styling.
- Our app could be useful for media students needing to save material regarding specific musicians or performers, or it could be a fun app for trivia night with friends.
- A problem we incurred with HTML was having an extra div that was creating problems with fixing our footer to the bottom of the page.
